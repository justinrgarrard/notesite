  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Notesite is a simple app for displaying Markdown notes stored in their own Git repository.</p>

  <h2>Reading Notes</h2>
  <p>Go to the <a href=notes/>notes page</a> to navigate between topics and entries.</p>

  <h2>Writing Notes</h2>
  <p>Notes are stored in their own Git repository and brought in via a Git Submodule. Simply push your changes on the notes repository, pulling to this repository when you're ready to update the website.</p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>I've tried a few other approaches to note-taking, but haven't been entirely satisfied with any of them.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Paper smudges and can't be edited easily.</li>
      <li>Plain text files don't have markup tools.</li>
      <li>Word documents aren't easy to organize across multiple topics.</li>
      <li>LaTex and HTML files aren't very readable.</li>
      <li>Wikis need their own infrastructure, like databases or hosting services.</li>
      <li>Note-taking apps (like OneNote and Cherrytree) are difficult to share.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Using directories and Markdown seemed like a good barebones strategy. Authors get full control over how they structure their notebook. They also get markup tools (bold, italics, etc.) without affecting legibility of the raw file.</p>

    <p>Jekyll adds readability, searchability, and ease of publication. Authors can choose to theme their notes if they want something a little fancier than raw text files.</p>
